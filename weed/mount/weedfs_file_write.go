/**
 * Write data
 *
 * Write should return exactly the number of bytes requested
 * except on error.  An exception to this is when the file has
 * been opened in 'direct_io' mode, in which case the return value
 * of the write system call will reflect the return value of this
 * operation.
 *
 * Unless FUSE_CAP_HANDLE_KILLPRIV is disabled, this method is
 * expected to reset the setuid and setgid bits.
 *
 * fi->fh will contain the value set by the open method, or will
 * be undefined if the open method didn't set any value.
 *
 * Valid replies:
 *   fuse_reply_write
 *   fuse_reply_err
 *
 * @param req request handle
 * @param ino the inode number
 * @param buf data to write
 * @param size number of bytes to write
 * @param off offset to write to
 * @param fi file information
